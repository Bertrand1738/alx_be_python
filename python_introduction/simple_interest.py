principal = 1000
rate = 0.05
time = 3
simple_interest = principal * rate * time
# The formula for simple interest is:# simple_interest = principal * rate * time
# The code calculates the simple interest based on the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period. 
print("The simple interest is: ", simple_interest)
